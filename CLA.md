# OpenMV, LLC's Software Grant and Individual Contributor License Agreement

By signing this contributor license agreement, I understand and agree that this project and contributions to it are public and that a record of the contribution (including all personal information I submit with it, including my full name and email address) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with this project, compliance with the open source license(s) involved, and maintenance of authorship attribution.

In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, OpenMV, LLC ("OpenMV") must have a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of OpenMV and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions submitted to OpenMV. Except for the license granted herein to OpenMV and recipients of software distributed by OpenMV, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

## 1. Definitions

- **"You" (or "Your")** shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with OpenMV. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means:
  - (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or
  - (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or
  - (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

- **"Contribution"** shall mean the code, documentation, or any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to OpenMV for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by OpenMV (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to OpenMV or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, OpenMV for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

## 2. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to OpenMV and to recipients of software distributed by OpenMV a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

## 3. Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to OpenMV and to recipients of software distributed by OpenMV a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license, with the right to transfer an unlimited number of non-exclusive licenses or to grant sublicenses to third parties, to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that are infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.  
If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

## 4. Representation of Authority

You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above license. If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to OpenMV, or that your employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with OpenMV.

## 5. Original Work

You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others). You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

## 6. Disclaimer of Warranties

You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an **"AS IS" BASIS**, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  
To the extent that any such warranties cannot be disclaimed, such warranty is limited in duration and extent to the minimum period and extent permitted by law.  
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will You or we be liable for any loss of profits, loss of anticipated savings, loss of data, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, and exemplary damages arising out of this agreement regardless of the legal or equitable theory (contract, tort, or otherwise) upon which the claim is based.

## 7. Notification of Changes

You agree to notify OpenMV of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.

## 8. Continuation Upon Death

In case of Your death, this agreement shall continue with Your heirs. In case of more than one heir, all heirs must exercise their rights through a commonly authorized person.

## 9. Severability

If any provision of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, such provision will be replaced to the extent possible with a provision that comes closest to the meaning of the original provision and that is enforceable. The terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement shall apply notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of this Agreement or any limited remedy to the maximum extent possible under law.

## 10. Governing Law

This Agreement and all disputes, claims, actions, suits, or other proceedings arising out of this agreement or relating in any way to it shall be governed by the laws of the United States of America, excluding its private international law provisions.

## 11. Entire Agreement

This Agreement sets out the entire agreement between You and OpenMV for Your Contributions to OpenMV and overrides all other agreements or understandings.
